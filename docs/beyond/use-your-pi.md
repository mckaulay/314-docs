# Use Your Raspberry Pi

After you've completed INFO 314, you should have a new appreciation and understanding for computer networking and how it can be applied in practice. One way to use what you've learned is to try your hand at some projects with your Raspberry Pi. 

As we learned through the course assignments, a Raspberry Pi can be configured as a piece of networking infrastructure. You can also follow online tutorials to use a Raspberry Pi as a network-wide ad-blocker, a VPN server, or a WiFI extender. Your Pi may also be useful in projects relating to streaming your own media collection, as well as in robotics.

## Project Resources & Tutorials

Bellow are some Raspberry Pi projects and collections of tutorials. Of course, you can always do your own searches to find possible projects which can use your Pi.
