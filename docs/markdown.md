**What is Markdown**

"Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)" [source](https://readwrite.com/2012/04/17/why-you-need-to-learn-markdown/). You will be expected to use this syntax for most of your class reports. You will find a file called `README.md` in the root of all of your GitHub repo folders. This is where you will be doing most of your markdown work.

**How do I get started?**

Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with Markdown, it's really easy to pick up. Github has great documentation on all of the things you can do with it here: [ mastering-markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide. Once you've taken a look at it follow this beginner's tutorial: [markdowntutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

**Additional advice**

When you're editing your `md` file in your computer, you'll want to know how your text would look like on Github as you're typing. I reccomend installing a couple extensions on VS code in order to make your life easier: `Markdown Preview Github` and `Markdown All in One`.

Each has instructions at the time of installation on how to use them.
